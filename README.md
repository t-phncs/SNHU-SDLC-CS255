<h4>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</h4>
<p> The client, Liam and Ian want to design their DriverPass system to train future driver to be well-prepared with their DMV driving test. They want the system to have a GUI with various functions for user to purchase packages, to schedule appointment, and to check user progress.
<h4>What did you do particularly well?</h4>
<p> I think I did particulary well in explaining how the system will be with UML use cases diagram as well as the activity diagram for login and purchase package.</p>
<h4>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h4>
<p> I would choose revise my use case diagram to be more details than my original one since it's very simple and it's not connected to any database in the AWS cloud </p> 
<h4>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h4>
<p>I terpret the user needs by translate the request from client for my use cases and implment them in the system design. User's needs are considered crucial in system designing because nobody is going to use a system that lack their desire feature</p>
<h4>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</h4>
<p> My technique would be including more use case from user's perspective to improve the adaptability and flexibility of the system</p>
